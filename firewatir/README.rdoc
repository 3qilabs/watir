== DESCRIPTION

Firewatir is part of Watir project, a family of open-source drivers for automating web browsers.
For other browsers please see www.watir.com

== EXAMPLES
* http://watir.com/examples

Start new Firefox browser driver

  # using Watir::Browser interface
  require 'watir'
  Watir::Browser.default = 'firefox'
  browser = Watir::Browser.new

  # or using Firewatir library directly
  require 'firewatir'
  browser = FireWatir::Firefox.new

Typical usage

  require "firewatir"
  # go to the page you want to test
  ff = FireWatir::Firefox.start("http://myserver/mypage")

  # enter "Angrez" into an input field named "username"
  ff.text_field(:name, "username").set("Angrez")

  # enter "Ruby Co" into input field with id "company_ID"
  ff.text_field(:id, "company_ID").set("Ruby Co")

  # click on a link that has "green" somewhere in the text that is displayed
  # to the user, using a regular expression
  ff.link(:text, /green/)

  # click button that has a caption of "Cancel"
  ff.button(:value, "Cancel").click

== FEATURES

FireWatir allows your script to read and interact with HTML objects--HTML tags and their attributes and contents.
Types of objects that FireWatir can identify include:

  Type         Description
  ===========  ===============================================================
  button       <tt><input></tt> tags, with the type="button" attribute
  check_box    <tt><input></tt> tags, with the type="checkbox" attribute
  div          <tt><div></tt> tags
  form
  frame
  hidden       hidden <tt><input></tt> tags
  image        <tt><img></tt> tags
  label
  link         <tt><a></tt> (anchor) tags
  p            <tt><p></tt> (paragraph) tags
  radio        radio buttons; <tt><input></tt> tags, with the type="radio" attribute
  select_list  <tt><select></tt> tags, known informally as drop-down boxes
  span         <tt><span></tt> tags
  table        <tt><table></tt> tags
  text_field   <tt><input></tt> tags with the type="text" attribute (a single-line
               text field), the type="text_area" attribute (a multi-line
               text field), and the type="password" attribute (a
               single-line field in which the input is replaced with asterisks)

In general, there are several ways to identify a specific object.  FireWatir's
syntax is in the form (how, what), where "how" is a means of identifying
the object, and "what" is the specific string or regular expression
that FireWatir will seek, as shown in the examples above.  Available "how"
options depend upon the type of object, but here are a few examples:

   How           Description
   ============  ===============================================================
   :id           Used to find an object that has an "id=" attribute. Since each
                 id should be unique, according to the XHTML specification,
                 this is recommended as the most reliable method to find an
                 object.
   :name         Used to find an object that has a "name=" attribute.  This is
                 useful for older versions of HTML, but "name" is deprecated
                 in XHTML.
   :value        Used to find a text field with a given default value, or a
                 button with a given caption
   :index        Used to find the nth object of the specified type on a page.
                 For example, button(:index, 2) finds the second button.
                 Current versions of FireWatir use 1-based indexing, but future
                 versions will use 0-based indexing.
   :xpath	     The xpath expression for identifying the element.

Note that the XHTML specification requires that tags and their attributes be
in lower case.  FireWatir doesn't enforce this; FireWatir will find tags and
attributes whether they're in upper, lower, or mixed case.  This is either
a bug or a feature.


== INSTALL
* http://wiki.openqa.org/display/WTR/FireWatir+Installation

Firewatir gen is normally installed during watir gem installation
however you need to install Jssh to communicate with Firefox.

  [sudo] gem install firewatir
